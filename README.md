# secrets-app
This is my first hands on experience at web dev , I have tried to create a secrets sharing website ,there is a room for lot of enhancements but its only my first project.
website name - secreto 
Link - https://intense-dusk-61961.herokuapp.com/

Stack used - Nodejs , Express , EJS 
Hosted on - Heroku

I created this website ti enhance my backend skills and get a hands on experience with api server calls ,therefore no specific front-end framework like Reactjs was 
used , I will surely try to update the frontend in future by using Reactjs
